# Know Issue / Dirty Hack
In order to get newer posts showing first, we have to set the date to be younger
than earlier posts, even though it was actually published later. Since the date
is not displayed on the website ~~(instead using `display-date`)~~, it is not a big deal, but it is a hack I would
like to fix and get posts to display properly without using it.
